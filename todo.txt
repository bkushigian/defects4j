update testOrder (don't move from location!)
finish fixing logging to files
move logs to $TMP


================
Line 75 of buildfile (framework/projects/defects4j.build.xml): imports things
that I want including bug-id

Add comments detailing
a. properties defined in buildfile
b. explanation of import of project-specific stuff at line 75
c. import relationship of all build files (graphic?) This should go into the
   developer documentation


=== UPDATING TEST ORDER

1. Make script point to /tmp/d4j/test-order/pid-vid.txt
2. Update framework/projects/defects4j.build.xml to point testOrder here
Q: Should we only use preSortedFile when we asked? For now, just tries to use
every time. This will blow up if the proper directory structure is not present!

=== Reflect changes to major/bin in original major repo
